# The Internet

The Internet was created as an experimental piece for my capstone project at Flatiron. I first started coding after a year of isolation due to COVID. As a trained artist, I knew that whatever I went "back" to had to be a creative pursuit. Little did I understand that code WAS art.

# Auth

The core functionality of The Internet is authentication and logging in, both inside and outside of this project. I wanted to heavily exaggerate component of logging in while focusing on the experience of a digital space as art. I want the user to use the login form as a means of traveling to other spaces on the internet.

# Tech

The Internet was created with a React front and and a Ruby on Rails back end. Full authentication was achieved through JWT and styling was done using vanilla CSS, p5.js and react-three-fiber.js. Facial recognition and machine learning was created with Tensorflow.js.
