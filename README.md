# The Internet

The Internet was created as an experimental piece for my capstone project at Flatiron. The requirements for the project were pretty open ended: We needed to create an application with a full stack, you had to use new technology, and there had to be full Authentication.

I had some incredibly ambitious ideas that I eventually had to abandon for later, and was presented with the question, "What if you only did auth?"

# Auth

The core functionality of The Internet is authentication and logging in, both inside and outside of this project. I wanted to heavily exaggerate component of logging in while focusing on the experience of a digital space as art. I want the user to use the login form as a means of traveling to other spaces on the internet.

# Tech

The Internet was created with a React front and and a Ruby on Rails back end. Full authentication was achieved through JWT and styling was done using vanilla CSS, p5.js and react-three-fiber.js
